Simple GML to XGMML Convertor

This software is based on Marcus Raitner Portable GML Parser. You can find
it in: http://www.infosun.fmi.uni-passau.de/Graphlet/download/

I added a new function: GML_print_xgmml to generate the xgmml file. 

To compile gml_xgmml.exe, just type 'make'. 

Usage: gml_xgmml.exe gml_file.gml > xgmml_file.gr

You can find one GML example : example1.gml. 

example1.gr was generated by gml_xgmml.exe :
     gml_xgmml.exe example1.gml > example1.gr
